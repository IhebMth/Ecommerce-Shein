## PART 1 — Analytics (Feature #20)

### What we built

`Analytics.js` is a **drop-in tracker** that sits silently on top of all your existing code. It intercepts your store's functions and fires events automatically — you don't have to touch Cart.js, Modal.js, or anything else.

**Events tracked:**

| Event | When it fires |
|---|---|
| `page_view` | Every time the page loads |
| `view_item` | When a product modal is opened |
| `add_to_cart` | Modal "Add to Cart" button OR quick-add card button |
| `remove_from_cart` | Trash/remove in cart panel |
| `begin_checkout` | "Proceed to Checkout" click |
| `purchase` | Order placed successfully |
| `wishlist_add` | Heart button → add |
| `wishlist_remove` | Heart button → remove |
| `search` | Search bar (fires 0.8s after user stops typing) |
| `filter_apply` | Category pill / nav tab click |

Supports **Google Analytics 4** and **Plausible** at the same time — or just one.

### Option A — Google Analytics 4 (Free, Google)

**Step 1 — Create a GA4 property**
1. Go to https://analytics.google.com
2. Click **Admin** (gear icon, bottom left)
3. Click **Create Property** → choose **Web**
4. Enter your site name (e.g. "NOVA Fashion") and URL
5. Click through until you see a screen with your **Measurement ID** — it looks like `G-A1B2C3D4E5`

**Step 2 — Add it to Analytics.js**

Open `Analytics.js`, find this section:

```js
ga4: {
  enabled: false,
  measurementId: 'G-XXXXXXXXXX'
},
```

Replace with:
```js
ga4: {
  enabled: true,
  measurementId: 'G-A1B2C3D4E5'   // ← your actual ID
},
```

**Step 3 — Verify it works**
1. Open your site in a browser
2. Open DevTools → Console tab
3. You'll see `[NOVA Analytics] EVENT: page_view` etc. in gold text
4. In Google Analytics → **Realtime** → you should see yourself as 1 active user
5. Once confirmed, set `debug: false` in the config

**What you can see in GA4:**
- How many people visit each day/week/month
- Which products get viewed most
- Where visitors drop off (view item → add to cart → checkout)
- Which country/device/browser your customers use
- How long people spend on your store

---

### Option B — Plausible (Privacy-friendly, No cookies, GDPR)

Plausible is the better choice if your customers are in the EU or you want a clean simple dashboard. No cookie banners needed.

**Step 1 — Create account**
1. Go to https://plausible.io (30-day free trial, then ~$9/month)
2. Sign up → Add Site → enter your domain (e.g. `novafashion.store`)

**Step 2 — Add it to Analytics.js**
```js
plausible: {
  enabled: true,
  domain: 'novafashion.store'   // ← must match exactly what you typed in Plausible
},
```

**Step 3 — Add the script tag to Index.html**

Plausible works via their CDN. The `Analytics.js` loads it dynamically, but for best reliability also paste this inside your `<head>` in Index.html:

```html
<script defer data-domain="novafashion.store" src="https://plausible.io/js/script.outbound-links.js"></script>
```

---

### How to add Analytics.js to your site

In `Index.html`, after the line with `Engagement.js`, add:

```html
<script src="Engagement.js"></script>
<script src="Analytics.js"></script>   <!-- ← add this line -->
```

It must be the **last** script — it needs all other functions to exist first.

## PART 2 — What Else Can Be Done

Here's everything remaining, ranked by impact vs effort:

### 🔴 High Impact, Easy

**1. Real product images**
Replace the Unsplash URLs in `products.js` with your actual product photos. Host them on Cloudinary (free tier) or just put them in your repo's `/images/` folder.

**2. Your WhatsApp number**
In `Index.html`, find the WhatsApp link and replace the phone number:
```html
href="https://wa.me/1234567890"  <!-- replace with your real number -->
```

**3. Your actual domain in meta tags**
In `Index.html`, replace all `https://novafashion.store/` with your real URL (you'll get this after Vercel deployment).

**4. EmailJS template fix**
Your EmailJS template ID is already set. Make sure in your EmailJS template the variable names match: `{{order_id}}`, `{{customer_name}}`, `{{customer_address}}`, `{{customer_phone}}`, `{{order_details}}`, `{{order_total}}`, `{{order_date}}`.

---

### 🟡 High Impact, Medium Effort

**5. Cookie / GDPR banner**
If you sell to EU customers, you need a cookie consent banner before loading GA4. A simple one can be built in ~50 lines.

**6. Product image hosting**
Move images off Unsplash (which can be slow and change URLs) to Cloudinary or Vercel's image optimization.

**7. Quantity controls in cart**
Currently users can only add more items by going back to the product. Add +/- buttons directly in the cart panel.

**8. Order history page**
Save completed orders to `localStorage` so customers can see their past orders even without an account.

**9. Facebook Pixel**
If you run Facebook/Instagram ads, add the Meta Pixel alongside GA4. Same pattern as Analytics.js — 10 lines of code.

**10. Size chart images**
The size guide popup currently shows text only. Add a real measurement chart image per category (Shoes, Leggings, T-Shirts).

---

### 🟢 Lower Priority

**11. Product reviews form**
Currently reviews are hardcoded. Build a simple form that saves to a free service like Supabase or Airtable.

**12. Stock management**
Right now stock numbers are static in `products.js`. Connect to a Google Sheet via API to manage stock without touching code.

**13. Instagram feed section**
Embed your Instagram grid at the bottom using a free widget like SnapWidget.

**14. Progressive Web App (PWA)**
Add a `manifest.json` and service worker so customers can "install" your store on their phone homescreen like an app.

## PART 3 — Deploy on GitHub + Vercel

This is the full process from zero to live URL in about 15 minutes.

---

### Step 1 — Create a GitHub account

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Sign up (free)
3. Verify your email

---

### Step 2 — Create a new repository

1. On GitHub, click the **+** icon (top right) → **New repository**
2. Name it: `nova-store` (or anything you like)
3. Set it to **Public**
4. Leave everything else as default
5. Click **Create repository**

---

### Step 3 — Upload your files

Your project is a static site (no build step needed). All your files go in the root of the repo.

**Using the GitHub website (easiest):**
1. On your new repo page, click **Add file** → **Upload files**
2. Drag and drop ALL your files:
   ```
   Index.html
   styles.css
   extras.css
   products.js
   i18n.js
   lang.js
   cart.js
   Shop.js
   Modal.js
   checkout.js
   darkTheme.js
   TrustBar.js
   Reviews.js
   InfoSections.js
   Engagement.js
   Analytics.js       ← the new file
   storage.js
   ```
3. At the bottom, click **Commit changes**

**Important:** GitHub is case-sensitive. Your `Index.html` needs to be exactly `index.html` (lowercase) — rename it before uploading. Same for script filenames — make sure the names in your `<script src="...">` tags match exactly (same capitalization) as the actual files.

**Quick rename checklist for Index.html script tags:**
```
index.html           (rename from Index.html)
lang.js              ✓
cart.js              ✓
Shop.js              ✓  (or rename to shop.js and update the tag)
Modal.js             ✓  (or rename to modal.js)
checkout.js          ✓
darkTheme.js         ✓  (or rename to darktheme.js)
TrustBar.js          ✓  (or rename to trustbar.js)
Reviews.js           ✓  (or rename to reviews.js)
InfoSections.js      ✓  (or rename to infosections.js)
Engagement.js        ✓  (or rename to engagement.js)
Analytics.js         ✓  (or rename to analytics.js)
```
The safest approach: **make all filenames lowercase** before uploading, then update the `<script src>` tags to match.

### Step 4 — Deploy on Vercel

Vercel is free, instant, and gives you a real HTTPS URL.

1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Click **Sign up** → choose **Continue with GitHub** (uses the same account)
3. Click **Add New Project**
4. Find your `nova-store` repository → click **Import**
5. Vercel will auto-detect it's a static site
6. Leave all settings as default
7. Click **Deploy**

In about 30 seconds, you'll see:

```
🎉  nova-store-abc123.vercel.app
```

That's your live URL! Share it with anyone.

---

### Step 5 — Connect a custom domain (optional)

If you want `www.novafashion.store` instead of the Vercel URL:

1. Buy a domain from Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Cloudflare (~$10–15/year)
2. In Vercel: go to your project → **Settings** → **Domains**
3. Type your domain → Vercel gives you DNS records to copy
4. In your domain registrar's DNS settings, paste those records
5. Wait 5–60 minutes for DNS propagation
6. Done — your custom domain now serves your Vercel site with free HTTPS

---

### Step 6 — Update your site in the future

After the initial deploy, updating is just:
1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Click the file you want to change → pencil icon to edit
3. Make changes → **Commit changes**
4. Vercel detects the commit and **automatically redeploys in ~20 seconds**

No manual redeployment ever needed.
